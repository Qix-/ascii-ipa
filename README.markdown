# Kirshenbaum ASCII-IPA to Unicode translator

An inefficient and ugly Python translator from the `sci.lang` and
`alt.usage.english` ASCII IPA format (as standardized by Evan
Kirshenbaum) and Unicode IPA glyphs.

It works well enough; pull requests happily accepted.

(As it happens, ASCII IPA is fairly convenient to enter on modern
touch devices. A link to a Gist for Pythonista is likely.)

[Evan Kirshenbaum][kirshipa] maintains the [specification][KPDF], as well
as a guide to its use. (But, for the moment, note the erratum found in
this repo's [docs/errata.markdown][errata].)
